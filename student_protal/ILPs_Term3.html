    <p>Hi everyone 👋</p>

    <p>It’s time to complete your Individual Learning Plan (ILP) for Term 3!</p>

    <p>Your ILP is shared with you in Google Classroom — it’s private between you and your RG teacher. Please:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Open your ILP document.</li>
      <li>Click the tab for Term [X].</li>
      <li>Answer each question honestly and thoughtfully.</li>
      <li>Save your responses.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Your RG teacher will review your ILP with you and leave comments.</p>
    <p>This helps you reflect on how you’re doing, set new goals, and plan your next steps.</p>

    <p>Let’s make sure all ILPs are completed by [due date] ✅</p>
